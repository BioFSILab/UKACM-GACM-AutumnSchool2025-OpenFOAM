### About solids4foam

---

**solids4foam** is an open-source toolbox based on the **finite volume method (FVM)**, integrated into OpenFOAM and foam-extend.
It is designed to perform **solid mechanics** simulations as well as **fluid–solid interaction (FSI)** using the finite volume approach.
This extends OpenFOAM’s capabilities beyond fluid dynamics into coupled multiphysics simulations.
